# KanbanBoard App

This is a Kanban board app built using Kotlin XML. It leverages the Android Drag and Drop API for task management rather than using the traditional `ItemTouchHelper`. The app includes integration with a **Notification API** where notifications are set with low importance, ensuring they don't disturb the user unnecessarily.

## Features
- **Drag and Drop**: Tasks can be dragged between columns using Android's Drag and Drop API.
- **Notifications**: Integrated with a Notification API to send low-importance notifications.
- **Tablet Optimization**: The app is designed specifically for tablets in **horizontal orientation**. While the app might function on mobile devices, it is best experienced on tablets in landscape mode.

## Usage
- The app works best when used on a tablet in **horizontal orientation**. You may try using it on a mobile device in horizontal orientation, but the design is optimized for tablet screens.
